During the battle \of the Somme in March, 
he lay in a grenade crater. \It was full of water.
You lay at the edge, at the top,\ducking your head to avoid the shrapnel.
While asleep it could happen \that you'd slide down and
your boots ended up in the water\and froze overnight.
Those were bad times.
He has had pains in his legs ever since. \Not as bad as the ones he has now.
He has only needed a cane\for the past year and a half.
The doctor says that too much work\may also be the cause.
Around here, there is a saying:
The work must be done. \We are here to do the work.
Sometimes it looks as if\a farmer has lots of money.
On arriving at a village it may seem\as if there was plenty of money around.
But as one knows, \appearances can be deceiving.
The machines cost a lot of money.
The farmer has to pay \today's prices for them,
which includes the high wages\of the steel workers,
the cost of materials, iron\and everything else.
So the farmer must pay the high prices,
while he can only charge the price\of ten years ago for his own product.
It just doesn't tally.
On top of that, the money for\the machines is hard to come by.
We sometimes have to scrimp \and save to pay for them.
On many farms, \people have to cut corners.
In my case it happened like this:
My old house wasn't worth fixing. \Therefore, I had to choose:
I either re-locate outside the village \or I go into business.
But I was able to settle here, \and I am happy.
It's a beautiful spot and I am content\to have re-located here.
But after all, there are\only two of us to do the work.
After re-locating we need more land, \but don't have enough machines for it.
Again, we have to buy machines\And keep animals and get other things.
So, for now, work isn't easy, \but I hope that it will slowly improve
and that we will be able\to buy machinery again.
In 1952, a new building\came into use at the dairy.
It was designed according \to current standards 
and equipped with modern machines.
The average daily milk yield\over a year amounts to 2,282 kg.
In 1955 it was 1,489 kg.
This indicates that productivity rose\while the number of suppliers fell.
Someone who comes from a family of farmers \will stick to his profession.
You don’t give it up easily. \You are your own master after all.
No one blows a whistle, no bell rings, \that’s the good thing about it.
But who is to know \whether it will last.
Dark clouds hang over\the farming profession.
Nobody knows what the future holds\and this weighs heavily upon us.
But I hope the best for the future\and that other professions
will understand the situation\and stand by the farmers.
Number of inhabitants: 485.\Religion: the majority are protestant.
Industries: a brewery, a terrycloth weaving mill, \a textile factory, a pasta factory.
Businesses: 7, farms: 62. 
Outgoing commuters: 55. \Incoming commuters: 15.
Yesterday it was really hot.
It would have been nice\to just sit in the shade.
The neighbour shouted:
“Why don't you sit down in the shade\under the trees?”
But they replied:\“What would the people say?”
“Who cares about what the people say?”\But one has to.
In the city, older people can\rest sitting on a bench.
In a small village like this one,\all the families know each other,
the good, and the bad.\Nothing remains unnoticed.
Right now, we are building\a water tank for the fire brigade
in the centre of the village.\There was a pond until 8 years ago.
It was used to water animals\and supplied water to extinguish fires.
All of this will be transformed \into a beautiful park 
with a playground for the children.
Besides the school and a flat \for teachers, the school building 
also houses the village council \as it’s currently being renovated.
The protestant primary school is\a two-tier rural school.
The 'lower class' includes grades\1 to 4, the 'upper class' grades 5 to 8.
Often, the teacher has to teach\two or more grades at the same time.
The pupils have therefore to do \a lot of independent work.
Educationally, this can be an advantage.
In order to compete with \a standard 8-grade school,
teachers and pupils have to work hard.
As they stay together for 4 years,\they get to know each other very well.
Every year, children leave school \and new ones arrive,
but each class keeps its traditions \and learning atmosphere.
Newcomers are integrated easily.
The country teacher knows \all the students and parents personally,
also through doing community work.\I conduct the mixed choir.
This type of engagement,\with the choir, the sports club,
or as an organist, is still almost expected \of a country teacher.
Though more activities mean more work\it can also make things easier.
We are a genuine rural school. 
Most of the students, 53% at the moment,\come from farming families.
This might change only slowly.
These pupils often have to do \farm work after school.
They lose part\of their summer holidays
as holidays are scheduled so as to allow\the children to help with the harvest.
They are quite happy to come to school\because here they can work and play.
These heavy demands on the children\can slow down their progress at school.
The parents, who all think positively\about the school, overlook this factor.
It breaks my heart that gifted children,\who won’t be able to take over
their parents’ farm later on, \are not allowed to learn another trade 
because their family’s business\needs their work input.
There is a wealth of talent here\which will only be realised,
once the school system has been reformed \enabling agricultural businesses
to function without child labour.
There are two class rooms,\but none for the teaching resources.
If we want to do physical education\when the weather is bad
we must remove the furniture \from the classroom and put it back later.
The building is on the main street\which corresponds to past ideals.
But the days of the much lauded\‘rural peace’ have long gone.
Even when it gets really hot we can’t open \a single window during class.
We have a relatively good supply\of teaching materials 
thanks to the village’s positive \attitude to the school.
But we still have to think\of getting a new building.
There are plans for a new \and larger central school 
for all the villages in the area.
It will be the first of its kind\in the canton of Münsigen.
A step forward for the welfare\of the rural population.
This knitware factory was originally \built by the municipality.
Later, Herr Stotz bought\and enlarged it.
Today they sew covers for packing\radios and television sets.
Many young girls also work there\to earn money for their dowry.
With the money they make, \they can buy quite a few things.
When things get tough\- during the potato harvest for example – 
they help at home.
The hourly wage is 2.30 marks. \If they are paid per piece 
some make more than 3.
In Würtigen, Stotz owns\another company like this
and a share in a veneer factory.\He has more than enough money.
There is a saying that he has more money\who has other's work for him.
Her name is Irene Rauscher, \and she is 24 years old. 
She has been working for Stotz\for six years now.
In 1963, the brewery celebrated\its 200th anniversary,
and the Speidl family\has owned it ever since.
In 1958 the brew house was renovated \and in 1963, the year of the bicentenary,
a new bottling station was built, \with a capacity 
of 4,000 to 6,000 bottles an hour.
His name is Alfred Rauscher,\he is 38 years old, 
and makes 3.50 marks an hour.
He is single and lives with his brother,\who runs the farm.
Sometimes he gives him a hand.
Nowadays, the farmers sleep\until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.
Years ago, one would set out for the field \to make hay at 3 in the morning.
Everyone had the same and\worked the same amount.
Those that always want more\aren't necessarily any happier.
On the 8th of July, \I came to Ödenwaldstetten 
to carry out vaccinations \against diphtheria.
All the children born in 1961 \were vaccinated 
against diphtheria and tetanus,
which will be repeated in a month.
The children born in 1958 receive \only one single jab against diphtheria.
This vaccination has been\very effective so far.
Since its introduction, no more cases\of diphtheria have become known.
For a few years now \it has been combined 
with a tetanus vaccination.
The village bakery has been here\as long as anyone can remember.
The council wanted to hire a master baker, \but the women wouldn't have it.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, lots are drawn\to determine the schedule for the ovens.
In the neighbouring village a new bakery\with electric ovens was built.
But most people say that the bread \from a wood-burning oven tastes better.
The communal laundry \has been here for a few years.
Lots of people from outside also\have their clothes washed there.
In 1957 I returned from Egypt\where I had been imprisoned.
I first started the pasta factory.
At night I made pasta \and during the day I worked on the farm.
In ‘57, I decided to set up\the terry-cloth factory.
In December ‘57 I started with 1 loom\and today I have 14.
At present 25 people work here, \plus six who work at home, 
four of whom are Yugoslav girls.
This is Mara Jakovlevic, from Ossijek.
She has been in Germany \since last December. 
She makes 2.50 marks an hour.
In 1960 we started keeping poultry\and last year we built a big hen house.
As farming alone is not enough\we wanted to specialise in poultry.
but egg prices are very low,\especially this year.
The production costs are barely covered.\And there is a lot to worry about.
Forty years ago, one still used a scythe\to cut the crop.
It was done with momentum\and required a lot of skill.
The young ones had to be taught.
In the days before fertilizers,\oats grew only half as high.
The crop yield is also higher today.
We used to laugh \when the short crop slipped 
through underneath the cradle.
After the collapse of the war\a few men returned
and founded the sports club.
In 1952 we incorporated\a shooting club.
We have about 70 members,\including about 30 youths.
Regrettably it is difficult today \to get young people 
interested in shooting,
maybe for reasons that we, elders,\don’t understand anymore.
But the young people of today \prefer going out…
But we have noticed that under\the guidance of the older members
the young people are ready\to participate.
Sometimes, there is a cattle market\over in Münsigen.
But it is quite a sorry affair nowadays.
The Jews from Buttenhausen\used to be the cattle dealers.
Commerce was good then.\There was a lot of buying and selling.
They would take the livestock \as far as the Rheinland, 
Frankfurt, or Mannheim.
Someone might buy 15 or 20 animals\all at once.
In those days, the livestock \was still driven to the station, 
without lorries,
or it was directly sold\to another farmer.
In Butthausen, the Jews had shops\and a cigar factory.
There also were some poor chap\who needed the support
of their fellow believers.
Some of them, those that grasped\the situation early on
and who had enough money\or family across the Atlantic,
they left for the U.S.A.\None of them have come back.
The synagogue was burnt down\during the Kristallnacht.
Those who stayed were all murdered.
The Christians in Buttenhausen\got along well with the Jews.
Some people say they were more fond of\the Jews than of the Christians.
In those days, no one was allowed\to say anything.
They would have taken you\to Dachau straight away.
Sweeping is done on Saturday \so that everything looks clean on Sunday.
A French soldier \who was quartered in the village,
saw the plaques with the names\of those killed in the war,
and he noticed that there had been\many from the village.
He asked: ‘Why so many young ones, why?’
What he meant was \that all of that had been for nothing. 
He was almost in tears.
They were led by a sergeant\who was a real fanatic.
During the retreat in 1945, \when the Russians
 were already in Germany,
he said to his company: “Comrades,\let’s just see what happens.”
And then he made off.
For the new building \of Mr. Fritz Brumm, 
who was the first to build \within our building line,
I, as the local carpenter,\did all the carpentry work.
What follows is the topping out speech\to celebrate completion of the roof.
“Here, for all to see,\stands a beautiful new house.
It sends its salute\far into the land.
And it pleases all those\who see it.
It fills the carpenter with joy\to build a stately home
that gives shelter\from heavy rains and raging northerlies.
and lets husband and wife \be safe and care for one another,
and bring up the children, \sprung from their happiness, 
to be good people.
Let such peace and quiet be\the owner’s fortune.
May he live here for all his life,\contented and in good health.
May the house one day be owned\by his children and grandchildren.
And may the lucky heir\know the same joy as he.
Here is what I wish, as I stand,\joyous at the finished work,
on this gaily decorated roof,\at these lofty heights.
Confident and full of hope,\and in the old tradition of our trade,
I raise my glass \and kindly ask all those gathered here 
to join me in calling out:
‘Long live Fritz Brumm and his family,
‘hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!”
 The church was starting to crumble.
It is 700 years old.\Now it has been renovated.
All the things from the past\and the war. They are almost forgotten.
There is always something new.
What lies behind us,\has been cut like hay.
