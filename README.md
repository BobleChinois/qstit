Qstit
====

**A simple program for film theaters and festivals to project extra subtitles on a dedicated screen or on top of the image.**

Free software (General Public Licence) developed by [Nova Cinema](http://www.nova-cinema.org) to project subtitles on top of the image or on another screen (this is called "soft-titling", "surtitling" or "supertitling"). It can also be useful for various types of events and in many contexts.
Qstit can read plain text files (.txt) or SubRip files (.srt) with timecodes.
The projection can be automated with SubRip files, the program can adapt the projection speed and resynchronize subtitles live in case of delay.
The subtitles and timecodes can be corrected directly inside the program if needed.
The display (position, size, font, colour, etc.) can be easily adjusted and settings can be saved for each subtitle file.

It’s pretty easy to use, the manual (available as pdf or as a help window inside Qstit) can give an idea of what it does and how it works.

Qstit is coded in C++ and uses Qt libraries (Qt4). It can be compiled on Linux, Windows and Mac. It is in an eternal beta state, but fully functional. Feedback welcome.

If you find this project useful, don’t hesitate to let us know and feel free to help or support in any way you can (financially, technically...).
