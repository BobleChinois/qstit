**A simple program to project extra subtitles on a dedicated screen or on top of the image.**

Free software (General Public Licence) developed by Nova Cinema to project subtitles on top of the image or on another screen (this is called "soft-titling", "surtitling" or "supertitling"). The software can read plain text files (.txt) or SubRip files (.srt) with timecodes. The projection can be automated with .srt files, the program can adapt the projection speed and resynchronize subtitles live in case of delay. The subtitles can be corrected directly in the program, the display (position, size, font, colour, etc.) can be easily adjusted.

If you find this project useful, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us and help or support in any way you can (financially, technically...).
