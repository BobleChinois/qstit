Qstit
=====

**Software for live projection and manipulation of electronic subtitles (or "surtitles", "supertitles", "soft-titles"...)**

Free software (GNU General Public Licence) developed by [Nova Cinema](http://www.nova-cinema.org) to project titles on top of the image or on another screen (this is called "surtitling", "soft-titling" or "supertitling"). It can also be useful for various types of events and in many contexts.
Qstit can read plain text files (.txt) or SubRip files (.srt) with timecodes.
The projection can be automated with SubRip files, the program can adapt the projection speed and resynchronize titles live in case of delay.
The titles and timecodes can be corrected directly inside the program if needed.
The display (position, size, font, colour, etc.) can be easily adjusted and settings can be saved for each subtitle file.
