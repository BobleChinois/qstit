Qstit 2.9.0
+++++++++++
There are small things that need to be corrected, changed or added but which aren't really problematic.
However, the problems listed below may cause you some trouble using Qstit, so please make sure you are aware of them:

- Qstit crashes if you try to open a file with an older version of the settings. If you have downloaded a new version of the program, delete your old settings files to make sure you won't encounter this problem.

- Qstit can read file encoded in UTF-8 and ANSI (ISO-8859-1), however sometimes it doesn't detect the encoding correctly. If you see weird characters, convert your file to proper UTF-8 using another program then open it again in Qstit.

- After having displayed certain windows like 'Help', the keyboard focus isn't placed on the controls.
You need to click on the control bar or the grid to make the keyboard shortcuts work again.


UBUNTU / MAC SPECIFIC:
----------------
The fullscreen is currently not working properly under Unity, the default desktop environment of Ubuntu. You can use alternative desktop environments such as Gnome-shell, LXDE (default in Lubuntu) or Cinnamon (default in Linux Mint) that can be easily installed on Ubuntu, you will then be able to switch from one to the other when logging in. KDE and others may also work fine, but we havenâ€™t tested them yet.

The same goes for MacOSX, however we don't know anyway to change it as you can't use another desktop environment on MacOSX.
